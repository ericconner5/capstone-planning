* Query Discogs for songs from the record label
* Query YouTube for available songs from record label
* Randomize YouTube results
* Playback YouTube results in embedded player
* Continue playback until finished with list

## Stretch Goals:
* Refine search filters to include genre, release date range, sold for range, sell for range, sold from range
* Integrate Firebase to store playlists
* Integrate an Add To Cart feature for Discogs store
* Integrate an Add To Wantlist feature for Discogs
* Integrate GoogleMusic if it can fill out gaps in YouTube search results

* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know?  Outline any issues that would impact use of your application.  Share any workarounds that are in place. }_

discogs API

youtube or GoogleMusic API

React

Sketch

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

Some extra site styling and query combinations would be the first stretch goals. Utilizing a database to store playlists would be a nice feature. Further development may include adding favorites to discogs.com wantlist.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

Firebase
